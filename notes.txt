There are 2 types of modifiers in prisma:

[] means it can be multiple
?  means it can be optional

When we have 2 references in 1:N relationship between table then use @relation to avoid ambiguity.

We can use select or include, we can't use both at the same time.

We can't use select with CreateMany function.
